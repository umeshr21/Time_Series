# Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and applying various time series analysis techniques to forecast future data points. It includes the implementation of models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and others to handle non-stationary data and capture trends, seasonality, and noise components in the time series.

## Introduction

Time series analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting future behavior based on past data. In this project, I explored different models to effectively analyze and forecast time series data, particularly focusing on handling non-stationary data through techniques like differencing, autoregression, and moving averages.

## Key Features

- Implementation of Zero Mean Models (White Noise)
- Random Walk Analysis
- Linear Trend Forecasting
- Seasonality Modeling
- ARIMA and SARIMA Models
- Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) Components
- Visualization of Time Series Data and Forecasts

## Models Implemented

This project explores and implements various models for time series analysis and forecasting:

- **Zero Mean Models (White Noise)**: 
  - Represent random noise with constant mean and variance, used to model irregular variations in a time series.

- **Random Walk**: 
  - Captures cumulative trends by summing independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) variables. Can be transformed into a stationary series through differencing.

- **Linear Trend Model**: 
  - Utilizes linear regression to model and forecast trends in time series data, particularly effective when the data exhibits a consistent upward or downward trend.

- **Seasonality Model**: 
  - Decomposes time series data to identify and forecast seasonal patterns, capturing periodic fluctuations within the data.

- **Autoregressive (AR) Model**: 
  - Models the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations, effectively capturing the persistence in time series data.

- **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**: 
  - Combines autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to handle non-stationary time series data and produce accurate forecasts.

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**: 
  - Extends the ARIMA model by incorporating seasonal components, allowing for the modeling of data with seasonal patterns.

## Results

The project achieved the following results:

- **Accurate Forecasting**: 
  - Successfully applied ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast future data points with high accuracy, effectively handling non-stationary and seasonal data.

- **Trend and Seasonality Insights**: 
  - Decomposed time series data to extract and visualize underlying trends and seasonal components, providing deeper insights into the data structure.

- **Model Evaluation**: 
  - Evaluated the performance of various models using statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), leading to the selection of the most effective model for forecasting.

- **Visualizations**: 
  - Generated comprehensive visualizations to represent the forecasted data, trends, and seasonality, facilitating a clear understanding of the time series behavior.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented models in capturing the essential characteristics of time series data and providing reliable forecasts.
